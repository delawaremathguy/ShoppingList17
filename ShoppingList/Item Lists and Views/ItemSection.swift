//	 MARK: - A Generic Sectioning of Items

/*
in a sectioned data display, one consisting of a list of sections,
and with each section being itself a list, you usually work with
a structure that looks like this:
	
	 List(sections) { section in
	     Section(header: Text("title for this section")) {
		     ForEach(section.items) { item in
	          		display the item for this row in this section
	     		}
		}
	 }
	
so the notion of this ItemsSectionData struct is that we use it
to say what to draw in each section:
	
	 -- its title and
	 -- an array of items to show in the section
	
to use the generic display structure, just organize your data as a
[SectionData] array and "plug it in" to the structure above.
*/

struct ItemSection: Identifiable, Hashable {
	var id: Self { self }  // so, this will work with ForEach, as if using id: \.self
	let title: String
	let items: [Item]
}
