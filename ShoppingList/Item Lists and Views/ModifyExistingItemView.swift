/*
the ModifyExistingItemView is opened via a navigation link from
 the ShoppingListView or the PurchasedItemTabView to do as it says:
 edit an existing shopping item.

this will be an "almost live edit," in the sense that when the user
touches the <Back button, we update the values of the Item with the
edited values.  however, because we have no way to intercept when the user taps
the Back button, we'll use our own Back button.
 
(we don't really need
this ... we could handle the update in an .onDisappear modifier as we do
over in ModifyExistingLocationView.  you can decide!  the downside of
handling this in .onDisappear is that we'll return to the previous screen
on the navigation stack, see the old presentation, and then see it update
for the edit.  also, we never really know when .onDisappear will be called --
or even if it could be called more than once.)

the strategy is simple:

-- create an editable representation of values for the item (a StateObject)
-- the body shows a Form in which the user can edit the values
-- and update the Item's values from the editable representation when finished.

struct ModifyExistingItemView: View {
	
	@Environment(\.modelContext) private var modelContext
	@Environment(\.dismiss) private var dismiss: DismissAction
	
	// an editable copy of the Item's data -- a "draft," if you will
	@State private var draftItem: DraftItem
	
	// provides a look-up of the real, live Item object in the
	// persistent store that gave rise to this draftItem's creation.
	// note: it is possible in this app that the real, live Item object
	// could be deleted while this view is active.  when it comes to
	// updating the item, we must check whether that
	// item is still out there.

	var body: some View {
			// the dismissAction function provides the DraftItemView with a way to dismiss
			// us, which is necessary should the item be deleted.  we could write this using
			// a trailing closure, but it's nice to know we can just pass the function's name
			// which is not "dismiss," but for syntax reasons with type DismissAction, we
			// must use its callAsFunction property.
		DraftItemForm(draftItem: draftItem, dismissAction: dismiss.callAsFunction)
			.navigationBarTitle("Modify Item")

	// i don't like the idea of using a custom Back button ... it does not
	// really look all that good, and you lose the ability to swipe back.
	// so this has to be localized, but it should at least point
	// in the right direction for all languages because of the use of the
	// SFSymbol "chevron.backward."
	//
	// i think there's a fix for the loss of swiping out there somewhere;
	// and if you're thinking "why don't you do this in .onDisappear?", the
	// visual is not great: we would dismiss the view, then we'd see the list
	// view, then we'd see the updated edit applied.  this way, we go back
	// to a list that's already updated.
	func customBackButton() -> some View {
		Button {
			// we need to ask if the draft "still" represents an existing Item.  it
			// certainly did when we opened this View, but if we hit the delete button
			// and confirmed the deletion, then this draft no longer represents a
			// real Item.
			associatedItem?.updateValues(from: draftItem)
			dismiss()
		} label: {
			HStack(spacing: 5) {
				Image(systemName: "chevron.backward")
