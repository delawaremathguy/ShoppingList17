// this view is for user preferences:

// Timer Suspension Preference
// -- whether to suspend the timer when the app goes into the
//    background.  perhaps useful if you don't want to count
//    time spent shopping that you're on the phone, or if you're
//    out browsing on the web.  you be the judge: maybe the phone
//    call is more a last minute shopping request from home, or
//    you use the web to compare prices while you're shopping.

	// user default.  true ==> turn off timer (counting) when in the background.
