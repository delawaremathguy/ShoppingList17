// this is a simple observable that holds a reference to
// the model context and makes available the number of items
// on the shopping list so we can maintain a badge on the
// shopping list item in a tab view (compact, horizontal
// appearance) or in a sidebar presentation for NavSplitView.
// we'll create it at the app level and drop it into the
// environment.

		countChanged() // update the count right away
	}
	
	// call this function whenever we physically move something
	// onto or off of the shopping list.  there might be a simpler
	// way to watch for changes directly (e.g., in core data, i'd consider
	// using a fetchedResultsController) or perhaps i could make this
	// an observer of some SwiftData/Core Data notification ... but that's
	// something i will leave for later ...
	// (it looks like the only notifications that SwiftData posts
	// are for willSave and didSave?)

/*
the App creates an InStoreTimer and pushes it into the environment,
for use with the Timer now displayed in the More... tab.
we also attach .onReceive modifiers to the MainView to watch being
moved into and out of the background to properly handle what to do
with the timer; and we push the shopping list count into the
environment.  Finally, we attach the SwiftData model container to
the WindowGroup, which places the modelContext into the environment.
