	// MARK: -- Useful Functions
	
	// note to self: this function has come and gone during
	// development. i would prefer to link a location to an item
	// with the statement:
	//   item.location = location
	// (this is how i would have done it in Core Data, so i would
	// not have to call the CD implementation of an addToItems
	// function.)
	//
	// but we can do it the other-way-round: append the item to
	// the location's optional array of items. this is basically
	// the equivalent addToItems function of CD and you would write:
	//   location.append(item: item)
	//
	// and from testing, it seems that using this append form may be
	// required to work properly with observation, and such is implied
	// in this article by Mohammed Azam:
	//   https://azamsharp.com/2023/07/04/the-ultimate-swift-data-guide.html
	//
	// note: was named `append`, but now renamed to `addToItems`, which
	// is not only a better name, but makes it more like what Core Data
	// would supply for you.
	func addToItems(item: Item) {
		// you probably want to remove this assertion in practice, but
		// i found it useful when getting my sea legs in SwiftData,
		// to be sure i have inserted a Location into the SwiftData
		// context before linking an Item to it.
		assert(item.modelContext == self.modelContext,
					 "*** trying to append item to location, but modelContexts not the same or missing.")

		// this is curious ... itemsOptional appears to be non-nil even when
		// there are no associated items. otherwise, how could you append
		// anything to build a relationship?
		itemsOptional?.append(item)
	}
	
	// this is the inverse of addToItems.
	func removeFromItems(item: Item) {
		itemsOptional?.removeAll() {
			$0.referenceID == item.referenceID
		}
	}
	
	// used to update an existing Location in the ModifyExistingLocationView,
	// based on data values of a DraftLocation.

		name = draftLocation.locationName
		if let components = draftLocation.color.cgColor?.components {
			red = Double(components[0])
			green = Double(components[1])
