	// using the cloud for syncing across multiple devices on the same
	// Apple ID (this should never happen on a stand-alone device with
	// no intention of using the cloud for sharing).
	//
	// EXAMPLE:
	//
	// (1A) install and run on a first device
	// (1B) an unknown location is created on your device
	// (1C) sync with the cloud
	//
	// (2A) install and run on the second device but without
	//      the cloud turned on or available.
	// (2B) the second device creates its own unknown location,
	//      before it can discover an existing unknown location
	//      in the cloud.
	// (2C) eventually, your second device finds the cloud and
	//      discovers an already-existing unknown location.

	// this function returns an unknown location that is accepted
	// as the unique unknown location known on a single device and
	// agreed to as the unknown location by all devices sharing
	// data across the same Apple ID.
	@discardableResult
	func resolveMultipleUnknownLocations() -> Location {
		// get all unknown locations
		let locationsToCondense = allUnknownLocations()

		// create the unknown location now if we don't yet have one
		if locationsToCondense.isEmpty {
			let location = Location(suggestedName: kUnknownLocationName,
															atPosition: kUnknownLocationPosition)
			insert(location)
			return location
		}
		
		// finding one unknown location is almost always the case,
		// so return the one we found
		if locationsToCondense.count == 1 {
			return locationsToCondense[0]
		}
		
		// so we have multiple unknown locations, probably because of an
		// iCloud syncing issue when installing on multiple devices
		// on the same Apple ID.  but we want the unknown location
		// to be unique.
		//
		// there is a way to solve the problem of reducing such multiple
		// unknown locations introduced by multiple devices into one.
		// indeed, if you find multiple unknown locations:
		//   - sort them by their referenceID.uuidString values (increasing).
		//   - accept whichever appears first among them to be the real, unknown Location;
		//   - move items from all other unknown locations to the real, unknown location;
		//   - and delete all those other unknown locations.
		// over time, different devices will come to agree on the real unknown location.
		
		// note: this seems to work in my tests ... fingers crossed for now.
