	// using the cloud and syncing across multiple devices on the same
	// Apple ID (this should never happen on a stand-alone device with
	// no intention of using the cloud for sharing).
	//
	// EXAMPLE:
	//
	// (1A) install app and run on a first device
	// (1B) an unknown location is (lazily!) created on your device
	// (1C) sync with the cloud
	//
	// (2A) install app and run on the second device, but with
	//      the cloud turned off or with it simply being unavailable
	//      (e.g., you're not connected to the internet).
	// (2B) the second device (lazily!) creates its own unknown location.
	// (2C) the second device eventually connects to the cloud and then
	//      discovers an existing unknown location from the first device.
	// (2D) now you have two unknown locations.  these have to be resolved.

	// this function returns an unknown location that is accepted
	// as the unique unknown location known on your device and is
	// also eventually agreed to as the unknown location of all devices
	// sharing data across the same Apple ID.
	
	@discardableResult
	func resolveMultipleUnknownLocations() -> Location {
		
		// we have multiple unknown locations, probably because of an
		// iCloud syncing issue when installing on multiple devices
		// on the same Apple ID.  but we want the unknown location
		// to be unique across all your devices.
		//
		// there is a way to solve the problem of reducing such multiple
		// unknown locations introduced by multiple devices into one.
		// indeed, if you find multiple unknown locations:
		//   - sort them by their referenceID.uuidString values (increasing).
		//   - accept whichever appears first among them to be the real, unknown Location;
		//   - move items from all other unknown locations to the real, unknown location;
		//   - and delete all those other unknown locations.
		// over time, different devices will come to agree on a single, unknown location.
		
		// note: this code has worked in my tests ... let me know if
		// you see any problems.  [my fear: we may be doing this somewhat
		// "underneath" SwiftUI and this could lead to one of those "purple"
		// warnings, but i have not seen this in the three of four times i
		// have tested with real devices.]
